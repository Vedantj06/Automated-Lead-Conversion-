# GitHub Setup Instructions

## Project Status
✅ **Fully Portable** - No longer depends on Devv backend
✅ **Production Ready** - All TypeScript errors fixed
✅ **Configurable** - Uses environment variables for all APIs

## Quick Setup for GitHub

### 1. Download Project
- Use the download/export feature in your Devv preview
- Or manually copy all files listed in PROJECT_FILES_LIST.md

### 2. Create GitHub Repository
```bash
# Initialize git
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Marketing Automation Platform"

# Add GitHub remote (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/marketing-automation.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Environment Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Update `VITE_API_URL` to your backend server
3. Add your API keys for external services (optional)

### 4. Backend Requirements
Your backend needs these endpoints (see API.md for details):
- `POST /auth/send-otp` - Send email verification
- `POST /auth/verify-otp` - Verify OTP code
- `GET /leads` - Get leads list
- `POST /leads` - Create lead
- `PUT /leads/:id` - Update lead
- `DELETE /leads/:id` - Delete lead
- `GET /campaigns` - Get campaigns
- `POST /campaigns` - Create campaign
- Similar CRUD endpoints for all features

### 5. Deploy Frontend
- **Vercel**: Connect GitHub repo, auto-deploy
- **Netlify**: Connect GitHub repo, auto-deploy  
- **Custom**: Build with `npm run build`, serve `dist/` folder

## Email Verification Fix
The email verification will work once you:
1. Set up a backend server with `/auth/send-otp` endpoint
2. Configure email service (Resend, SendGrid, etc.) in your backend
3. Update `VITE_API_URL` in your .env file

## Next Steps After Upload
1. Set up backend server (Node.js/Express, Python/FastAPI, etc.)
2. Implement the API endpoints listed in API.md
3. Configure email service for OTP delivery
4. Test the complete authentication flow
5. Deploy both frontend and backend

The frontend is complete and will work perfectly once connected to a proper backend!
